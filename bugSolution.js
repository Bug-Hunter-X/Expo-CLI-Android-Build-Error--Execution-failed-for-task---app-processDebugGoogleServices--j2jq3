The solution involves ensuring that the `google-services.json` file is correctly configured and placed within the `android/app` directory of your Expo project.  Verify that the contents are consistent with the Firebase project setup. If you're using multiple Firebase services, make sure they're properly integrated. Also check the version compatibility between Firebase SDK and other dependencies. If conflicts persist, try cleaning the project using `expo prebuild --clean` before attempting to rebuild.
